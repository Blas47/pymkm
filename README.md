# üìô PyMKM

Python wrapper for the [cardmarket.com API](https://api.cardmarket.com/ws/documentation/API_2.0:Main_Page) (version 2.0, using OAuth1 and the "Dedicated app" option).

The included sample app can update your stock prices to trend for non-foils, and to a competitive prices for foils, all rounded to nearest configurable value per rarity (default .25 ‚Ç¨). A confirmation step allows you to check the result before uploading the new prices.

The app can import a .csv list of cards to your stock. It can also be used to clear your entire stock.
The app also keeps track of how many API requests your have left each day, and can do partial updates if you have more than 5000 articles to update.

**NOTE:** Use all functionality at your own risk, I take no responsibility for the resulting prices or wiped stock. See 'price calculation' below for more details.

**NOTE 2:** This app collects a tiny amount of usage data. The purpose is to allow me to see what people use the most and to focus on improving that. If you want to opt out from this, please change `"reporting": true` to `false` in `config.json`.

## üî® How

1. Install requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Copy `config_template.json` to `config.json` and fill in your API keys.
1. Run `pymkm.py`.
1. Profit.

## üìà Price calculation

The prices for non-foils are the "trend" prices supplied by Cardmarket. I only look at English cards for now.
Cardmarket does not however supply trend prices for foils, so my algorithm is this:

_NOTE: This is a rough algorithm, designed to be safe and not to sell aggressively._

1. Filter out foils, English, not altered, not signed, minimum Good condition.
1. Set price to lowest + (median - lowest / 4), rounded to closest rouding limit.
1. Undercut price in seller's own country by the rounding limit if not contradicting 2)
1. Never go below the rounding limit for foils

Base prices (‚Ç¨) and discounts for lower grading (decimal %) can be set in `config.json`.

## üîì Locking prices

Should you want to avoid updating certain articles in your stock, set the starting character of the comment for that article to `!` (possible to change which character in `config.json`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Config parameters

### `price_limit_by_rarity`

Set a lower price limit (and also rounding target) for different rarities.
_Example_: `"mythic": "1.0"` would set the lowest price Mythic rarity cards to ‚Ç¨1, and would set prices to round to nearest ‚Ç¨1.

### `discount_by_condition`

Set a decimal multiplier on each card condition level.
_Example_: `"PL": "0.5"` would set the price for Played cards to 50% off the trend price.

## üìÑ CSV importing

If you scan cards using an app like Delver Lens or the TCG Player app, this feature can help you do bulk import of that list.

Drop your list of cards into a file called `list.csv` in the root directory (there is an example file included in this repo). The file has to follow this format (including the header row):

```
Card,Set Name,Quantity,Foil,Language
Dragon Breath,Scourge,1,Foil,French
```

Remove all quotation marks and extra commas in card names.

Any cards that fail to import are written to a new .csv file called `failed_imports.csv`.

## üìä Competition view

This feature allows you to get a better view of how you should price individual cards depending on your local market and also the whole market:
